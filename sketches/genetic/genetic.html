                    These particles are born in the left half of the screen, and are left to wander around...
                    After some number of iterations, those who are in the right half of the canvas, <span style="color: blue;">survive</span>, the others, are <i style="color: red;">killed</i>.
                    Admittedly it's a rough world to live in, but that's life.

                    <br>
                    Each particle has a small (and i mean <i>really small</i>) neural network brain that takes 4 inputs: the distance from the particle to each wall.
                    The neural network outputs 2 numbers: these are used as a displacement in the x axis (dx) and a displacement in the y axis (dy).

                    <br>
                    When particles survive the death round, they are grouped in groups of 2 to produce a child particle.
                    The child particle's brain is built using parameters from each of its parents, without any particular logic involved. They are then taken to the next round along with their creators.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Interestingly, the parameters of each particle's brain are never trained <i>per-se</i>, but simply built out of the parents brains. Another interesting fact is that particles are
                    never told to go right; they don't even know how the output of their brain is being used. They essentially have zero feedback from the environment. But since we only keep the particles
                    that behaved in a certain way, we end up with a population that has the sought-after characteristics.

                    <br>
                    This is the process of natural selection.

                    So, next time you see a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samara_(fruit)">Samara</a> flying in the wind and wonder how smart nature is to develop these beautiful structures that optimize
                    seed propagation; keep in mind, those who can't compete... will die.
