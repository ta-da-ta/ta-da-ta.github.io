                    This is a sand simulation that works as a cellular automata. Each grain of sand is updated according to the value of its direct three bottom neighbors.
                    If the immediate bottom cell is empty, then the grain of sand falls in it. If the bottom cell contains another grain of sand, then the grain of sand will either stay where it is or fall on either side of that other grain of sand if any of the two cells are empty.
